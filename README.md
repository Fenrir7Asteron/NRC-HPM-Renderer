# NRC-HPM-Renderer

This project is the implementation of my bachelor thesis [Real-time Neural Radiance Caching in Heterogeneous Participating Media](doc/bachelor_thesis_german.pdf). A volumetric path tracer is augmented by terminating paths early and approximating the remaining radiance using a multi layer perception. This MLP is called the Neural Radiance Cache.

Further information can be found in the [thesis](doc/bachelor_thesis_german.pdf).
