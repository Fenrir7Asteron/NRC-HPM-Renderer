# NRC-HPM-Renderer

This project is the implementation of my bachelor thesis "Real-time Neural Radiance Caching in Heterogeneous Participating Media". A MLP is used to approximate the 5D radiance distribution within a participating medium. In rendering a path is terminated into the MLP which returns the approximated radiance.

The thesis can be found in the "doc" folder.
